### Rpi5 control fan program
This is a small D program to control a Rpi5 computer's fan based on:
https://github.com/NikPiermafrost/rpi5-ubuntu-server-fan-script

Requirements:
* [vcgencmd (Rpi utility)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/os.html#vcgencmd)
* [ldc2 (D LLVM compiler](https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc)
* [make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software))
* [upx](https://github.com/upx/upx)
* [SystemD (for provided service)](https://github.com/systemd/systemd)

SystemD service is configured to run at 3 speed (FanSpeed.HIGH), to use
automatic fan speed based on temperature thresholds, change
the following line in the `control_fan_systemd.service` file before
installing the service to be:
```
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/control_fan 0
```

Manual invokation once installed (not recommended, for reference only):
`sudo/doas control_fan <speed>`

If you are writing a service for a init system,
you will want to run as the root user and invoke:
`/usr/local/bin/control_fan <speed>`

Where **speed** is one of the Integers below:

|Integer|Fan Speed | Temp |
|-----|-------------------|------|
|  4  | FanSpeed.FULL      | >= 50째C|
|  3  | FanSpeed.HIGH     | >= 40째C|
|  2  | FanSpeed.MEDIUM   | >= 30째C|
|  1  | FanSpeed.LOW      | >=  0째C|
|  0  | FanSpeed.AUTOMATIC | As above |

Build:
`make`

Install as service:
`sudo/doas make install`

Remove as service:
`sudo/doas make uninstall`
